I have gathered all the necessary information to reconstruct the API documentation for the RF-Client. I will now generate a comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification based on the source code analysis.

The documentation will include:
1.  **API Server Overview**: Base URL and general response structure (`ResResult<T>`).
2.  **Authentication**: Bearer Token mechanism and the login/registration flow.
3.  **Endpoints**: Detailed definitions for:
    *   **User Management**: Login, Register, Profile Update, Password Reset, Badge Management.
    *   **Workshop/Components**: Upload, Update, Delete, Search, and Download components.
    *   **Question Bank**: Creator certification quiz management.
    *   **System/Updater**: Client update checks and server list retrieval.
    *   **Dictionary**: System configuration retrieval.
4.  **Data Models**: JSON Schemas for all DTOs and Entities (`User`, `Component`, `QuestionBank`, `MissionPack`, etc.).

I will provide the output in a clear, structured format, including the OpenAPI YAML block and a textual explanation of the business logic.
